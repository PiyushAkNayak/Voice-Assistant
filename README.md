The project aims to develop a personal-assistant for Desktop. It has been designed to provide a user-friendly interface for carrying out a variety of tasks by employing certain well-defined commands. Users can interact with the assistant through voice commands. 
In this project we mainly use voice as communication means so the assistant is basically the Speech recognition application. 
As a personal assistant, it assists the end-user with day-to-day activities like general human conversation, searching queries in google, searching for videos, live weather conditions, health recommendations based on symptoms and reminding the user about the scheduled events and tasks. The user statements/commands are analysed with the help of machine learning to give an optimal solution.
